title: "PyTorch Implementation of Neural Radiance Fields"
date: 2026-12-01
excerpt: "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a framework for learning continuous 3D scene representations from a set of 2D images by modeling how light is emitted and absorbed along camera rays. In this project, I implemented NeRFs as presented by Mildenhall et al. (2020) in NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis. My implementation included ray generation, stratified and hierarchical sampling, positional encoding, and volumetric rendering."
