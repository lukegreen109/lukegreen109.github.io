I am a math masters student at Brigham Young University set to graduate April 2026. My research experience has mainly been concerned with spectral graph theory and active learning. Coming soon: a paper on the Construction and Properties of Non-Backtracking Matrices of Graphs. My thesis will be on improvements to the state-of-the-art online batch selection methods for deep neural network training and how introducing randomness can lead to faster convergence in prediction space.

Research Interests
======
My interests are centered around the Mathematics of Machine Learning. I appreciate rigorous mathematical treatment of machine learning methods, and I am especially interested in foundational understanding of deep learning and neural networks.

- Uncertainty Quantification
- Sampling Methods
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Randomized Methods
- Active Learning
- Graph Based Methods
- Vision/Image Classification

I would like to get more involved with applications to energy and neuroscience.
