We investigate the relation between the generalized characteristic polynomial and the determinant of the non-backtracking matrix of a graph. Our result is a method of generating graphs which have cospectral non-backtracking matrices, by using GM-switching. We investigate properties of these families of graphs, as well as properties of graphs which have cospectral non-backtracking matrices and do not belong to these families. We compare the number of cospectral graphs with respect to Adjacency, Laplacian, Normalized Laplacian, Sign-Less Laplacian, Ihara Quotient matrices, and Non-Backtracking matrices. We also investigate the degree sequences of non-backtracking cospectral graphs.
